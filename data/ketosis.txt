A ketogenic (ketosis) diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet designed to induce a metabolic state known as ketosis. In ketosis, the body shifts from using glucose as its primary energy source to burning fats. The typical macronutrient distribution in a ketogenic diet involves a high percentage of calories from fats, a moderate amount from protein, and a minimal intake of carbohydrates.

The key principles of a ketogenic diet include:

Low Carbohydrate Intake: Carbohydrates are significantly restricted, typically constituting only 5-10% of total daily caloric intake. This restriction aims to deplete the body's glycogen stores, leading to the production of ketones from fat for energy.

Moderate Protein Intake: Protein intake is moderated to prevent excess protein from converting into glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis. Protein typically makes up around 15-30% of daily caloric intake.

High Fat Consumption: Fats become the primary source of energy, comprising around 70-75% of daily caloric intake. Healthy fats, such as those from avocados, nuts, seeds, and oils, are emphasized.

Benefits of a ketogenic diet may include weight loss, improved blood sugar control, increased satiety, and potential cognitive benefits. However, it's essential to approach a ketogenic diet with caution, considering individual health needs and consulting with a healthcare professional, especially for those with certain medical conditions. Additionally, maintaining proper nutrient balance and choosing healthy fats is crucial for overall health on a ketogenic diet.
